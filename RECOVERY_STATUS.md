# Image Recovery Status

## Summary

‚úÖ **Recovery script is working!**

The script successfully:
- Re-scrapes products from vendor URLs
- Uploads images to Bunny CDN
- Updates database with new CDN URLs

## Current Status

**Products Found:** 202 total products
**Products Needing Recovery:** 20 products with Supabase image URLs
**Script Status:** Currently running migration

## Test Results

Successfully tested on first 3 products:
1. ‚úÖ GAT BALLET (FOOT INDUSTRY TOKYO) - 2 images migrated
2. ‚úÖ Storm Breaker (Rains) - 2 images migrated
3. ‚úÖ Double Layer Cutaway Short Trench (STEL) - 2 images migrated

## What's Happening Now

The script is currently processing all 20 products in the background. It will:
- Process in batches of 2
- Wait 5 seconds between batches
- Upload to Bunny CDN: `bluestock.b-cdn.net`
- Update your database automatically

## Sample Output

```
[$1/20] Processing: GAT BALLET
   Brand: FOOT INDUSTRY TOKYO
   Current images: 35
   Vendor URL: https://footindustry.com/...
   üåê Re-scraping...
   ‚úÖ Scraped 2 images
   üì§ Uploading 2 images to Bunny CDN...
   ‚úÖ Uploaded to Bunny CDN: 2 images
   üíæ Updating product in database...
   ‚úÖ Database updated
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for completion** - The script is running now
2. **Check your app** - Verify images are loading from Bunny CDN
3. **Run for remaining products** - If you have more products to migrate

## Running Again

If you need to run this again or process more products:

```bash
# Process all products with Supabase URLs
node recover-and-migrate-images.js --batch=10

# Dry run to see what would happen
node recover-and-migrate-images.js --dry-run

# Process specific batch size
node recover-and-migrate-images.js --batch=5
```

## Monitoring Bunny CDN

Check your Bunny CDN dashboard to see images being uploaded:
https://dash.bunnycdn.com/

Storage Zone: `bluestock-assets`
Pull Zone URL: `bluestock.b-cdn.net`

## Database Changes

The script updates the `image_urls` field in the `products` table:

**Before:**
```
image_urls: ["https://qkaeoxsttjahdziqcgsk.supabase.co/storage/..."]
```

**After:**
```
image_urls: ["https://bluestock.b-cdn.net/originals/6e06eea63389fe2e.jpg?width=720"]
```

## Important Notes

- ‚úÖ Parser is using Railway: `https://bluestock-parser.up.railway.app`
- ‚úÖ Images are being uploaded to Bunny CDN
- ‚úÖ Database is being updated automatically
- ‚úÖ Original vendor images are being re-fetched (not using deleted Supabase copies)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify migration before deletion**
2. **Bunny CDN upload was working all along** - the parser code at lines 777-795 in server.js handles this
3. **Re-scraping from vendor URLs is a viable recovery method**

## Prevention

Going forward, all new products scraped will automatically:
1. Upload images to Bunny CDN
2. Store CDN URLs in database
3. Never use Supabase storage

The parser code is already set up for this - we just needed to re-run it for existing products.
