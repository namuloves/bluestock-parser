# Gradual Rollout Configuration
# Copy these to your .env file or set as environment variables

# ROLLOUT MODE OPTIONS:
# - disabled: Don't use lean parser at all
# - trusted_only: Only use lean parser for trusted domains (Week 2)
# - percentage: Use lean for trusted + random % of others
# - primary_with_fallback: Always try lean first, fallback to V3 (Week 3)
# - full: Always use lean parser only
LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=primary_with_fallback

# Percentage of non-trusted domains to use lean parser (only for percentage mode)
LEAN_PARSER_PERCENTAGE=0

# Main parser version (keep as v3 during rollout for safety)
PARSER_VERSION=v3

# Example progression:
# Week 2: LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=trusted_only
# Week 2.5: LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=percentage, LEAN_PARSER_PERCENTAGE=20
# Week 2.7: LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=percentage, LEAN_PARSER_PERCENTAGE=50
# Week 3: LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=primary_with_fallback
# Week 4: LEAN_ROLLOUT_MODE=full, PARSER_VERSION=lean
