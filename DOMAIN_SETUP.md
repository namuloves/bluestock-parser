## ðŸš¨ Required Manual Steps:

```

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your `bluestock-parser` project
3. Click on the service
4. Go to "Variables" tab

### 2. Update Main Bluestock App

Go to `/Users/namu_1/bluestock` and update:

**Environment Variables (.env.local):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://bluestock-parser.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.mmmmood.com
```

**Update any API calls or CORS configuration** that reference the old domain.

---

### 3. Cloudflare DNS (if not already done)

Make sure you have these DNS records:

**A Records (or CNAME to Vercel):**
- `mmmmood.com` â†’ Points to Vercel
- `www.mmmmood.com` â†’ Points to Vercel

**Redirect Rule (optional but recommended):**
- Create a redirect rule: `mmmmood.com/*` â†’ `https://www.mmmmood.com/$1` (301 permanent)

---

### 4. Update CDN Configuration (Optional)

If you want to rebrand your Bunny CDN:

**Current:** `bluestock.b-cdn.net`
**To change:**
1. Go to BunnyCDN dashboard
2. Rename pull zone or create a new one
3. Update environment variables:
   ```
   BUNNY_PULL_ZONE_URL=mmmmood.b-cdn.net
   BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE=mmmmood-assets
   ```

**Note:** This is optional - you can keep using `bluestock.b-cdn.net` if you prefer (it still works fine).

---

## Testing Your Domain

After completing the manual steps, test your domain:

### 1. Test Frontend
```bash

### 2. Test API
```bash
curl https://bluestock-parser.up.railway.app/test

## Questions?

- **Why www.mmmmood.com instead of mmmmood.com?**
  You configured Vercel to redirect from non-www to www, so we're using www as primary.

- **Do I need to update the CDN?**
  No, the CDN domain (`bluestock.b-cdn.net`) can stay the same. It's just a CDN URL, users won't see it.

- **Will old links break?**
  If you keep the old Vercel deployment active with a redirect, old links will redirect to the new domain.
