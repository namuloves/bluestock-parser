## 🎯 How It Works

### Scraping Flow
1. URL comes in → Detect site type
2. Known scrapers → Use specific scraper
3. Redirect/affiliate → Follow redirects → Scrape final destination
4. Unknown site → Check if Shopify → Use Shopify scraper
5. Still unknown → Generic extraction attempt

### Key Features
- **Automatic Shopify detection** for unknown stores
- **Redirect following** up to 10 levels deep
- **Proxy support** for anti-bot sites (Etsy, Poshmark, etc.)
- **Fallback extraction** for unknown sites
- **Category detection** using AI
